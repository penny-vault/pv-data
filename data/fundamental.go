	// quarterly and trailing-twelve-month dimensions (ARQ;MRQ;ART;MRT); and
	// 2015-12-31 for annual dimensions (ARY;MRY). We also employ offsets in
	// order to maximise comparability of the period across companies. For
	// example consider two companies: one with a quarter ending on 2018-07-24;
	// and the other with a quarter ending on 2018-06-28. A naive normalization
	// process would assign these to differing calendar quarters of 2018-09-30
