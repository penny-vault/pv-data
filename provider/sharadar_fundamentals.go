type sharadarFundamental struct {
	Ticker                                  string  // 0 = ticker (text)                     [Entity] The ticker is a unique identifier for a security in the database. Where a company is delisted and the ticker subsequently recycled for use by a different company; we utilise that ticker for the currently active company and append a number to the ticker of the delisted company. The ACTIONS table provides a record of historical ticker changes.
	Dimension                               string  // 1 = dimension (text)                  [Entity] The dimension field allows you to take different dimensional views of data over time. ARQ: Quarterly; excluding restatements; MRQ: Quarterly; including restatements; ARY: annual; excluding restatements; MRY: annual; including restatements; ART: trailing-twelve-months; excluding restatements; MRT: trailing-twelve-months; including restatements.
	CalendarDate                            string  // 2 = calendardate (date (YYYY-MM-DD))  [Entity] The Calendar Date represents the normalized [ReportPeriod]. This provides a common date to query for which is necessary due to irregularity in report periods across companies. For example; if the report period is 2015-09-26; the calendar date will be 2015-09-30 for quarterly and trailing-twelve-month dimensions (ARQ;MRQ;ART;MRT); and 2015-12-31 for annual dimensions (ARY;MRY). We also employ offsets in order to maximise comparability of the period across companies. For example consider two companies: one with a quarter ending on 2018-07-24; and the other with a quarter ending on 2018-06-28. A naive normalization process would assign these to differing calendar quarters of 2018-09-30 and 2018-06-30 respectively. However; we assign these both to the 2018-06-30 calendar quarter because this maximises the overlap in the report periods in question and therefore the comparability of this period.
	DateKey                                 string  // 3 = datekey (date (YYYY-MM-DD))       [Entity] The Date Key represents the SEC filing date for AR dimensions (ARQ;ART;ARY); and the [REPORTPERIOD] for MR dimensions (MRQ;MRT;MRY). In addition; this is the observation date used for [Price] based data such as [MarketCap]; [Price] and [PE].
	ReportPeriod                            string  // 4 = reportperiod (date (YYYY-MM-DD))  [Entity] The Report Period represents the end date of the fiscal period.
	LastUpdated                             string  // 5 = lastupdated (date (YYYY-MM-DD))   [Entity] Last Updated represents the last date that this database entry was updated; which is useful to users when updating their local records.
